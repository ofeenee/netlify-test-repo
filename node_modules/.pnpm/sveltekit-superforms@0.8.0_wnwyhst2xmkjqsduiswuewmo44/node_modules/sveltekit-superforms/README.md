Making SvelteKit **validation** and **display** of forms easier than ever!

# Feature list

- Merging `PageData` and `ActionData` consistently - Forget about which one to use and how, just focus on your data.
- Server-side data validation using [Zod](https://zod.dev), with output that can be used directly on the client.
- [Auto-centering and auto-focusing](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/error-handling#usage-client) on invalid form fields.
- [Tainted form detection](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/tainted), prevents the user from losing data if navigating away from an unsaved form.
- No JS required as default, but full support for [progressive enhancement](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/enhance).
- Automatically coerces the string data from `FormData` into correct types.
- For advanced data structures, forget about the limitations of `FormData` - [Send your forms as devalued JSON](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/nested-data), transparently.
- Generates [default form values](https://superforms.vercel.app/default-values) from validation schemas.
- Support for [nested data structures](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/nested-data), [snapshots](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/snapshots) and [multiple forms](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/multiple-forms) on the same page.
- Works both on the server and with [single-page applications](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/spa) (SPA)!
- [Proxy objects](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/proxy-objects) for handling data conversions to string and back again.
- [Client-side validators](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/client-validation) for immediate user feedback.
- Provide submit state feedback with three [auto-updating timers](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/timers), based on human perception research.
- Even more care for the user: No form data loss, by [preventing error page rendering](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/enhance#differences-from-sveltekits-useenhance) as default.
- Hook into [a number of events](https://superforms.vercel.app/concepts/events) for full control over the `ActionResult` and the validation update, with a possibility to cancel the update at every step.
- Complete customization with a [huge list of options](https://superforms.vercel.app/api#superformform-options).
- Comes with a Super Debugging Svelte Component: `SuperDebug`.
